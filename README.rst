Python implementation of the `hostapd control interface
<http://w1.fi/wpa_supplicant/devel/hostapd_ctrl_iface_page.html>`_.

This library currently implements only a subset of the features available to
the C version.

For an alternative library, you may want to take a look at a (practically
line-by-line) port of the C library `gevent-wpactrl
<https://github.com/wolfhechel/gevent-wpactrl>`_.

This library is still in early stages, so please swing later.
